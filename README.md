# svg-napkin
When you share some "Back of the Napkin"-ish results, you don't want your audience thinking they're final, precise, reliable, official, etc. So I like to use a visual style that makes it very clear.

Lots of TODOs: add support for text-wrapping and re-sizing, fill option for shapes, add axes, arrows, and a dataset object.
